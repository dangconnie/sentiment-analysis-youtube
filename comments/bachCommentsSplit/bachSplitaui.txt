@Musicaliters First I thought that so but when I was in Hamburg and listed Mozart among the Germans I received a surprised look and was explained that it wasn't so. From that moment I started considering him Austrian. But I think we are splitting hairs  because few centuries ago European nation-states were just in statu nascendi and one's national identity wasn't as clear-cut as today. That's why neither Mozart nor Haydn did not compose e.g. German Requiem like Brahms - a century later.
