Children should be exposed to this music early. If for any other reason their own sanity. My son's favorite when he was two years old was Mozart. I taught him to read at age two and at five years old he was reading college level. I do not consider this unique in any way. \Baby\ books give out so much disinformation I wonder if this in itself is not a conspiracy to keep the average child stupid. You don't have to be rich or privileged to give the best education to a child. Just my thought.
