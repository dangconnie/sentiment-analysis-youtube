@November10th1775USMC Actually the writing of the Torah precedes both Greek and Roman civilizations.  I guess if you use a late date it's right around the time of the rise of Greek culture.  But the (initial) Old Testament precedes the founding of Rome much less anything that can be called an \empire\ by hundreds of years.  The New Testament of course was composed/assembled in the first few centuries CE...
