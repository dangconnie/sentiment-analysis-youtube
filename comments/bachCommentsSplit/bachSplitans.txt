@Sanotaru92 If you're not thinking or talking about Christ when listening to Bach then you don't understand his music. Bach was a Lutheran Kantor in Leipzig Germany. As Kantor he was responsible for writing liturgical music for the churches of Leipzig. He was also in charge of Christian education in the town which meant that he was theologically trained. Bach's music is interlaced heavily with Christian theology and themes. That's why he's often called the 5th Evangelist.
