To Richardsharp447: What a lovely sense of humor~ :)\n\nBach is my favorite among the dead composers and I would gladly awake to hearing his music.\n\nThat said there are somewhat more lively versions of this piece but I have yet to come up with a better melody myself.\n\nActually on my deathbed I enjoyed this piece while going into the next realm...
