@Chefodeath \nIt doesn't matter as arguing that still never proves god either way and being this is a Bach video I couldn't care less to argue...but no you don't need evil to have free will.  Good and evil in general are not in the world things and actions that are white and black the way that religion buffs think.  Not to mention a child that is born and dies from starvation for example never had the free will to avoid it.
