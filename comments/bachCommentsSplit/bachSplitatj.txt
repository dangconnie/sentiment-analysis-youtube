@eskindian Wow!  I am so moved by this kind gesture from you.  It made me cry!  Good cry though.  It is amazing how kind words can make someone feel so much better especially during difficult times.  I always live my life trying to say nice things to people I know & don't know too.  This is how I was raised.  My father-in-law being a retired pipe organ builder from Germany loves classical music.  He cried when I played this.  Thank you for the prayers.  This means so much to me!  Blessings!
