Bach is the greatest composer and musical master of Western Music! He is so close to God with his soaring imagination and depth of understanding. I personally don't know if I believe in God but Bach brings me to God anyhow. His melodies are so beautiful! His orchestrations so flawless and multifaceted; his fugues so intense and brilliant; his music so challenging to complacency in every way so forward looking; his mind searching the cosmos for the perfect means to express its grandeur.
