Bach's music is definitely intelligent but most of all it's complex. He is able to write religious pieces such as this one without compromising the abstractness mathematical rigour underlying his compositions. Music is subject to fashions; but if I'd have to bet I would say the only timeless creations wiill be Bach's. And if you're interested in how complexity system maths are linked to Bach (or the opposite) I suggest you read \GÃ¶del Escher Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid\ by Hofstadter.
