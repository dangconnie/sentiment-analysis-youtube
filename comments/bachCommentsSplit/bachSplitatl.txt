My father-in-law that lives with us in the back house told us he is going to refuse kidney dialysis & wants to live the rest of his life here until it becomes too difficult for us to care for him.  He had a defibrillator put in @ the end of Sept & now his kidneys are failing.  I have been acting as his nurse/caregiver & try to talk to him with positive thoughts to make him feel better.  Makes me cry.  I take care of him like he is my own dad.  He is a retired organ builder & loves this song.
