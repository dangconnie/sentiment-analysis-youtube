Since I was born into 90s pop 2000s pop Nicki Minaj isnt a total drag to me... She's got a unique persona and everything aside from flashing like everyone else does nowadays. I play violin so this music was always around my house and I've grown to love it... As well as classic rock techno some arias and even rap. LOL
