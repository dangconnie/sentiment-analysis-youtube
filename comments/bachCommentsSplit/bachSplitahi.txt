I don't mean to insult him by calling his music fashionable. It's a compliment actually. I think we can agree that Bach was intensely popular in the 1600's and is not so popular today outside of classical circles. I'm saying nothing about his music only the amount of people that listen to it.\n\nMy last comment was only trying to express that Bach doesn't divide people by intelligence but taste.
