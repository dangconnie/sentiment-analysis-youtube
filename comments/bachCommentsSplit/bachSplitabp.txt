Bach's compositions are not only melodically beautiful they are mathematically and geometrically perfect. There is a sense of symmetry and order to them that makes them perfect for small children. Kids joyfully learn about symmetry when they hear the fourth part of a Bach quatrain. My Dad insisted on playing classical music (in addition to children's music) when I was small and my elementary and high school music and choral teachers widened my horizons. I learned to appreciate all forms and styles of music but classical was the foundation upon which all was based. Music can add peace and joy beyond measure to one's life.
