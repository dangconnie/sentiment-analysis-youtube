In truth there is no love in the universe which is not ultimately the\nlove of God of the Sacred and no beauty which is not the reflection of\nDivine Beauty. Even a person who thinks that he is an atheist when he\nsays ‘‘I am an atheist and I do not believe in anything’’ he has actually\ntransferred his religious love and devotion to something else other than\nformal religion but the search for love and beauty still exists in him\neven if he is unaware of their transcendent Source. When such a person\nif he is sensitive to music listens to Johann Sebastian Bach or Mozart\nhe wants everything to be very quiet concentrating completely with his\nwhole soul in a state of devotion. In fact what he is doing is searching\nfor the Sacred in this beautiful music but he is not aware of the real\nsource of this attraction for his soul. What is it that is attracting him to\nBach or Mozart ‘‘religiously’’? Why is he so much interested in this\nmusical experience? Where does this state in his mind and soul come\nfrom? Often he is not aware enough to really sit down and seek to\ndiscover what the source of this ‘‘feeling’’ is.\n(Seyyed Hossein Nasr)
