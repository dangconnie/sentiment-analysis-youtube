@LambdaQuarks To the problem of evil (you're actually presenting Hume's version not the Epicurean version) I direct you to the free will defense presented by Alvin Plantiga.\r\n\r\nFree will is a good thing so good that its worth having evil in the world to allow it. You have to allow your free actors to do evil on occasion or else its not really free will is it?
