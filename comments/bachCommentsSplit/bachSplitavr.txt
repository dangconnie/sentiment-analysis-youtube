@jimraw1  @rumpranger65 yes I am aware of that but what strikes me from my few stays in Germany is that in protestant churches there the *congregation* actually sings Bach chorals almost every Sunday as a regular part of the service. It's not just the organ that plays a toccata while people walk out or a boringly played 'jesus joy of man's desiring' at a funeral; people actually *own* Bach's music. I don't go often to catholic churches but I can't remember ever singing Bach there...
