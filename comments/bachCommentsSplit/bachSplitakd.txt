Written by my mother: \Lately I fall asleep listening to this music\ Indeed my mother was a dilettante not only liked classical music but also art. She taught us a lot and since then I love the nineteenth century be it music be it art or history whether literature either photography ... I give it to hear my daughter occasionally and Guridi Ravel Aranburu Zuri√±e Gerenabarrena Carmelo Bernaola Sarasate Arriaga (all Basque composers) and others. Sorry fr my trrible English. Thnks a lt.
