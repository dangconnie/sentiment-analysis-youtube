@LambdaQuarks If there is no good and evil then why the fuck are you bringing up the argument from evil as it obviously carries no weight with you. Also explain to me as well how you can have moral free will without evil. You get to choose between good and...more good?\r\n\r\nAs to the existence of unnecesary evil are you familiar with multiverse theory? Perhaps God a being of eternal giving and benevolence felt obligated to create all possible worlds with more good than evil.
