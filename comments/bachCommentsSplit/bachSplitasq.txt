@studioworks1990 Well... it's wikipedia it's not the most reliable. \n\nBut classical music is primarily music from the Classical Period such as Mozart. \n\nBaroque music is from the Baroque period.\nI could be wrong though classical music could be the overall genre and Baroque just a separate form of classical.\n\nNonetheless amazing piece.
