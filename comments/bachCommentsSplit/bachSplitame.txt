i dislike most of religions. i love bach's music. problem? then keep it to yourself cause i don't give a damn. i just came here to listen to a beautiful masterpiece and you should shut the hell up and do the same. if you wanna bash religion or fight for it go to some forum. this is youtube. more importantly this is BACH. peace ;)
