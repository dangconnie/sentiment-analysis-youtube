Wealthy men AND women were more more rotund during this (and other) times. If you live in a time and place that many of your neighbors--even ones in large houses and huge estates--are going hungry then being plump becomes a status symbol.  \I have so much money I eat to excess\.  Put on top of that being a church organist a cantor and a composer are all generally done sitting on your duff for hours on end while eating a steady diet of German food and being a little plumb isn't surprising...
