Think twice before replying. Context matters. First of all: \Classical music\ is an accepted acception oposed to let's say Jazz or Pop and therefore it's OK to call ALL composers of what some would call \Western Erudite Music\ \Classical\. Secondly are you sure about Beethoven being a classical composer? Since you seem to be splitting hairs here should I remind you that his style is only classical during his youth and he is widely regarded to be the first romanticism composer?
