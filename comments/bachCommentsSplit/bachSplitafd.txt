You were the one who started your stupid conversation in the first place. He countered your point that 240p is the lowest in Youtube and you tried to make his point look like that 240 is HD. This is called a logical fallacy. i'm sure he's quite aware that 240 is not HD even if it's not the lowest allowed either. Take your cookies and condescending diction elsewhere that we may enjoy the music.
