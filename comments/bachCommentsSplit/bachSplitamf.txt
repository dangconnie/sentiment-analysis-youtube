We live in a time where music is only limited by the performers skill and the composers insight. The muse never left you just cannot profit so heavily from it anymore. And to real musicians none of that should matter. If you have seen no local live music this week you are doing yourself a disservice as a music lover. Listen and love all music you can find it everywhere.
