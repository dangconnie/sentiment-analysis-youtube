Bach was born in 1685. During his lifetime his music was not nearly as popular or revered as it is today. Unlike the cosmopolitan and internationally celebrated Handel Bach did not travel through Europe. He stayed in Germany mostly working church jobs. His later work was seen as old-fashioned not nearly fashionable and cutting-edge \galant\ composers like Hasse were held in higher regard.
