@Aragalinna You know in German the word \patriotisch\ is barely used if not to describe someone from another country. Hitler wasn't German by the way. At least not if you compare his world view to contemporary German culture (okay the interaction is very complicated).\r\nAnd just for the future: Try not to generalise 80 million individual persons under a broad-brush term. We honestly don't like that too much.
