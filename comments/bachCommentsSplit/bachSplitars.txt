@LambdaQuarks To which I must argue that evil IS a requisite for the establishment of moral free will under what it seems to be a do-or-dont decision making situation. Without understanding evil you cannot commit evil and since you do not have the capacity to commit evil you inherently do not possess moral free will.\nAnd I agree. If God created an infinite number of multiverses it just suggest he's an imperfect slob. Please dont insult \him\ with your crazy theories chef.
