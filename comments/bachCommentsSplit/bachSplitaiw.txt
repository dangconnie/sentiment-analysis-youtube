No this is the Baroque period before the classical period; which most people know of Mozart Beethoven and others from the classical period. After the classical period comes the Romantic period which is famous for TONS of composers like Schubert Schumann Brahms Chopin. But I LOVE Bach and you can never go wrong listening to all of his works. That's what all of the great composers till this day do.
