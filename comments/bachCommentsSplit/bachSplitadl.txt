Bach an unparalleled musical genius.\n\nHis music is more than a composition of notes. It exists. Not in the normal sense of the word though. It may not be able to have conversation with you or touch you physically for instance but it does things that a person can't do. It inhabits your soul and lives with you for a while. It comforts you; helps you understand yourself in such a personal way. For these reasons listening to Bach is serious business. It's like entering into a deeply intimate relationship - one that is in a way intimate beyond the parameters of any normal relationship.
