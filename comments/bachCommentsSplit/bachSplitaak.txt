Steven Hancoff has 14 videos that contain a short synopsis of Bach's Life. In one video he claims that Art needs no human confirmation. Even Bach's closest friends did not know of his composition. He was lost to the public for almost 100 yrs. until Felix Mendelssohn and friend staged the St. Matthew Passion. Critics and some intellectuals panned it. The people loved it. Since then Bach has become a household name. Musicians were always familiar with it  the Well Tempered Clavier and such. Beethoven once said \Bach is an ocean.\
