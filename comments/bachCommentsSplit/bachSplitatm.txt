@Aragalinna \People are different\ - yeah right?! Good to hear that from you.\r\n\r\nAnd yes we don't like that. Nobody likes being generalised; or do you?\r\nYou don't have to change your opinion I never asked you to. I was just pointing out that it is a dumb and generalist opinion which is my opinion about yours. You can think whatever you want but that doesn't make it less dorky. And it won't prevent people from disagreeing with you. Yeah it's all new and magic and sparkles!
