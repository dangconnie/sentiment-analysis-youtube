Thanks for the information - it's obviously missing in the headline as so often on YT...... Though the uploaders are great they ar omitting the basic data too much I think. Generally: I am no Christian (never was) but I find this piece to be deeply touching. It's solemn without being pathetic. There are few classic tunes I can hear before going to bed - this is one of them.
