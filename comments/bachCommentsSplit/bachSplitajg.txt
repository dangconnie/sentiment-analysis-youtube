Thanks a lot I'll definitely read the books (it'll be good practice for my almost forgotten German :-)! And sorry for the delay in my answer: your comment seems to have been blocked out as Spam (one wonders what's YouTube policy on spreading culture) and unluckily my own account is linked to an email address I barely use. So thank you again and keep posting here: it's nice to read something that actually opposes the too-regular mindless opinions based on uninformed dogmatic beliefs...
