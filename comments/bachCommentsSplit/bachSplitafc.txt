Oh was my comment distracting you from enjoying the music? Most people I know listen with their ears not their eyes. How about this: instead of white-knighting with your broke-ass english why don't you just close your eyes and listen to your \high quality\ Bach that's probably playing through some shit quality computer speakers so you probably don't even notice the muffled mids non-existent highs and distorted bass.
