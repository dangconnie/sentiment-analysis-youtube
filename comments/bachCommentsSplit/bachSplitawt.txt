That's not the case anymore. While it was true for a long time (I think it came up during JFK's funeral) since Vatican 2 things have changed. Look how often Jesu Joy of a Man's Desiring is used at Christmas and funerals. I dont think Bach was ever banned (he was hired by a Catholic prince to write music for the church) it was his \secular\ pieces - Wagner's and Mendelsohn's wedding marches were also banned at one point - but that hasnt been the case for over 40 years.
