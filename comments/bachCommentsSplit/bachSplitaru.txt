@Chefodeath \nI never said there is no good and evil. I said that it isn't as simple as just simply those two categories. Many morals and ethics are innate in us for evolutionary benefits. Humans specifically are a highly social and cultural species. We understand the suffering of others and even other animals show the same behavior. Your god created an infinite amount of multiverses idea is laughable I guess it is true when they say religious people play the god card no matter what we discover.
