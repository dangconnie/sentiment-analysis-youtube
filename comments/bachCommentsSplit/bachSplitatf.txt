@eskindian Unfortunately so much fluid accumulated in his lungs & he couldn't breathe.  We have good news that he went to emergency and they started him on dialysis with a tube through his neck.  Now he is able to breathe better & will continue w/dialysis 3x a week.  I think it scared him enough to change his mind.  I am so thankful for that!  I will be consistent with monitoring him here @ home & continue to be his nurse/caregiver.  Thank you for your prayers!  So happy that he can breathe!  :)
