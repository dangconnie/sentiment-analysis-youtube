In 1687 John Dryden wrote a beautiful poem “A Song for St. Cecilia's Day” when Johann Sebastian Bach was about 2 years old.\n\nFrom time to time I read the poem listen to music such as this then read the​ poem once more.\n\nThen I sit quietly and let the memory of the poem and the music sink in.\n\nIt is a most profound experience.
