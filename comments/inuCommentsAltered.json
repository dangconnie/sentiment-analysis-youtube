Nintendo should really do something like this for Pokemon Symphonic Evolutions and put the tracks on a CD for all fans to listen to. The tracks here are beautiful and Pokemon deserves this kind of treatment too.

@xxxMelodyOfDawnxxx Glad you like it! 
thank you SOOOO SOOOOOO SOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH! for putting this up! i was dying to find this it's gorgeous music! 
I agree. This was a very beautiful song. I loved the actual ending theme but then the made it even more awesome. I dont think any or many songs in wind could compare. This song wins... hard. Inuyasha for the win. 
Glad you like it!\r\n\r\nThere are a few websites that have the album for download or you could find the CD on eBay. 
OMG i am going to die if i don't have this album i want it so bad!!!\r\ni love inuyasha!!!
